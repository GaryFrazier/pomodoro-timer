Pomodoro timer with ticking

There are a lot of pomodoro timers out there and there are a lot of ticking sounds, but I couldn't find an application that combined both, so I made this.

I wanted the full pomodoro experience that originally involved a ticking kitchen timer, and it turns out that the ticking sound can really be very useful.

This is a pomodoro timer with the ticking sound.
